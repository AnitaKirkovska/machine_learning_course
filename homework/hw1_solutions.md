## Problem 2

Note that the code for Problem 1 and Problem 2 is almost identical. You only have to delete ```sigma_prime(z)``` in the line where you compute ```grad_weights``` and ```grad_bias``` in the method ```fit``` of the class ```Model```. The advantage of the binary crossentropy function is that neurons learn faster.
